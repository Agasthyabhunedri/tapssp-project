# Introduction to Rust

Rust is a systems programming language focused on safety, speed, and concurrency.
It achieves memory safety without a garbage collector by using ownership and borrowing rules.

Key features:
- Zero-cost abstractions
- Fearless concurrency
- Memory safety guarantees
- High performance comparable to C and C++

Rust is widely used for performance-critical applications such as browsers, game engines, operating systems, and blockchain clients.
